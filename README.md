Search Queries Anomaly Detection

This project analyzes **Google Search Queries** data to detect anomalies and identify top and bottom-performing queries based on CTR (Click-Through Rate).  
It visualizes the data using **Plotly** for interactive charts.

Project Overview

This project helps you understand which search queries perform best (high CTR) and which perform poorly (low CTR).  
It uses Python and data visualization to find anomalies in query performance metrics.

**Key steps include:**
1. Loading and cleaning the dataset  
2. Handling missing or invalid CTR values  
3. Detecting anomalies using statistical thresholds  
4. Visualizing:
   - Top 10 queries by CTR  
   - Bottom 10 queries by CTR  



##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Plotly Express** – Interactive visualizations  
- **NumPy** – Numeric computation  
- **Google Colab** – Development environment  



## Visualizations

The notebook generates:
- Bar charts for **Top Queries by CTR**
- Bar charts for **Bottom Queries by CTR**
- Highlighted anomalies (optional extension)

 
Top Queries by CTR
